# Planned-Leanring
Not having a sechedule that is given to you or a schedule that you choose to attend to learn something can be hard, especially for me as finding the motivation to giving time to learn can be hard. It is easy to just get off of work and turn off your brain and lesiure around. We may have sparks of motivation for a new passion project but there are many other projects and passions that go left untouched. For me personally alot of that is due to the fact I over think things and it stops me from moving forward with a project even though I already have the items neede to start. Just got to take the just do it approach and make mistkes cuz we aint gonna get things correct the first time. Even though writing these things out to take note of my sucess and mistakes along the way will take extra time, it will be a good reminder and place holder for if I drop a project for some time at least I will have a good place holder to return too without having to relearn what I forgot to continue.
