# Planned-Learning
Not having a schedule that is given to you or a schedule you choose to attend to learn something can be challenging, especially for me, as finding the motivation to give time to learn can be challenging. It is easy to get off work and turn off your brain and leisure around. We may have sparks of motivation for a new passion project, but many other projects and passions go left untouched. A lot of that is due to the fact I overthink things, and it stops me from moving forward with a project even though I already have the items needed to start. We must take the do-it approach and make mistakes because we don't get things correct the first time. Even though writing these things out to take note of my success and mistakes along the way will take extra time, it will be a good reminder and placeholder for if I drop a project for some time, at least I will have a suitable placeholder to return to without having to relearn what I forgot to continue.
